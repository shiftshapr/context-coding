- `WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md` – **Step-by-step workflow** from task identification to completion (planning, execution, monitoring, troubleshooting)
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` – the orchestration system prompt you currently send.
- `CURSORRULES_GENERIC.md` – universal red-line policies for all projects
- `CURSORRULES_EXTENSION_EXAMPLE.md` – extension-specific rules (browser extensions only)
- `CURSORRULES.md` – index explaining which rules to use
- `AGENT_DESCRIPTIONS.md` – agent roles/responsibilities reference.
- `DEFAULT_WORKFLOW_MANIFEST.md` – Default Collaboration Workflow Manifest (execution order + reporting requirements).
